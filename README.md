# koda_score_webapp

A reliable outcome measure is needed for bowel preparation quality during capsule endoscopy. Currently, no scales are adequately validated. Our objective was to update an existing small bowel preparation score, create a standardized training module, then determine its inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. It is an updated and validated bowel preparation scale for patients undergoing small bowel capsule endoscopy.
